#include "AdjacencyAlgorithms.h"

/***
The following code was written in its entirety by David Last and David Rivera of the University of Pennsylvania as of February 22, 2019.

Overall Comments:

There are two approaches which are being implemented for clustering in the below which will be referred to as Adjacency and Clustering in the relevant comments. Both only look at primitives from within some set-size time window (chosen to be 50 us as to combat Ar39). Adjacency then just asks how many adjacent hit wires are there in the window and for the window reports the largest number. For the Clustering, it is more complicated and will be described below. But it further breaks the window up into smaller chunks for clustering hits together, but still calculates total charge and maximum single primitive charge and time over threshold (TOT) for the whole window. This will be relevant prior to the detailed description of the algorithms.

Functions that are associated with the Adjacency method will end with "Prim" and that which is associated with Clustering will end with "Cluster". The exception to this rule is in the section of PRIMARY CLUSTERING FUNCTIONS. So they will be clearly explained. The functions for which this applies have mostly been replaced.

Presently due to speed and comparable selection ability, the method of "Adjacency" is favored.
