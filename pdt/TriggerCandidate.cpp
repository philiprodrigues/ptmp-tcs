/*
The following function takes some set of hits for a single APA, sorts them as necessary, and then performs the Adjacency/Clustering with the full calculation as specified in AdjacencyAlgorithms.cpp for the protoDUNE-specific scheme for horizontal muons.
The output mirroring a trigger candidate (sans metadata) will have the 8 outputs corresponding to:
0-3) TADC, Adjacency/Clustering, WADC, TOT 
4-7) first channel APA-wise of largest cluster, its associated tick, last channel APA-wise of largest cluster, its associated tick
