#+title: ptmp-tcs: PTMP + Trigger Candidate source

This project integrates some TC/TD finder algorithm functions to [[https://github.com/brettviren/ptmp][PTMP]].

* Source

Functions may be provided as C++ source files held in other Git repos
which are then integrated into ~ptmp-tcs~ via ~git-subrepo~.  This allows
the original authors to continue to develop the code as needed while
~ptmp-tcs~ provides an integration path to DAQ running at ProtoDUNE.

Each repo is connected into a sub directory of this project

- [[pdt/]] :: https://github.com/dlast44/ProtoDuneTrigger 
- [[met/]] :: https://github.com/IrisP25/MichelElectronTriggering

    --prefix=$HOME/opt/ptmp \
    --with-ptmp=$HOME/opt/ptmp \
    --with-libzmq=$HOME/opt/zmq \
    --with-libczmq=$HOME/opt/zmq \
