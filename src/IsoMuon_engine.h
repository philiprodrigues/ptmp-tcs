// A simple TPFilter engine designed for finding isochronous
// ("quasi-horizontal") tracks. The input is assumed to be windowed
// with TPWindow and sorted with TPZipper, and then the trigger
// condition is that at least N channels are hit in one of the time
// windows.
//
// This is a particularly simple and not very smart condition: a
// nearly-horizontal muon will trigger if it happens to fit in one
// time window, but will not trigger if the same muon is displaced in
// time a bit so that it straddles two windows. Also, there's nothing
// in the algorithm itself forcing the muon to be "horizontal": if you
// make the TPWindow wider, the muon can go at any angle as long as it
// "fits" inside the time window. Horizontalness is imposed by making
// the TPWindow narrow.  Despite these limitations, this is still good
// enough for testing the trigger things we care about.
//
// The number-of-channels threshold is set as number of channels _per
// link_, so that we can feed this algorithm any number of links
// (which could be multiple APAs). The condition is just applied as a
// total number of channels hit: that is, the threshold is (hits per
// link)*(n links) and there's no requirement that *every* link has a
// given number of hits.
//
// There are 96 collection channels per link, some of which are dead
// or suppressed because they're noisy, so sensible values for the
// number of channels per link are 80-90 or so.
//
// We also need to know the number of links that are feeding this
// algorithm, which we take to be the maximum number of links seen so
// far for one time window.
